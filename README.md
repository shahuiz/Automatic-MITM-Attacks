# Automatic MITM Attacks
This project focuses on the automation of Meet-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks on symmetric-key cipher designs, including:
1. 7-round AES128 single key MILP MITM
2. 8-round AES128/9-round AES192 related key MILP MITM
3. 9-round AES192 related key MILP MITM with superposition technique
